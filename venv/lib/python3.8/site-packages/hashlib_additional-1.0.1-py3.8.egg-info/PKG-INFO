        About
        
        This module packages several additional hashing digests in a
        hashlib-compatible format. It implements the following digests:
        
        -   null - Always outputs null byte "hashes", with a configurable
            digest_size
        -   random - Always outputs random "hashes", with a configurable
            digest_size
        -   crc32 - CRC32 digest, 4 byte digest_size
        -   adler32 - Adler-32 digest, 4 byte digest_size
        -   bsd - BSD checksum, 2 byte digest_size
        -   udp - UDP checksum, 2 byte digest_size
        -   twoping - 2ping checksum, 2 byte digest_size
        
        Unless stated, all digest outputs are big-endian (network byte order).
        
        
        Example
        
            >>> import hashlib_additional
            >>> digest = hashlib_additional.new('crc32')
            >>> digest.update(b'foo')
            >>> digest.hexdigest()
            '8c736521'
        
            >>> hashlib_additional.algorithms_available
            {'twoping', 'random', 'bsd', 'null', 'udp', 'crc32', 'adler32'}
        
            >>> digest = hashlib_additional.twoping(b'bar')
            >>> digest.digest()
            b'+\x9e'
