        Overview
        ========
        
        `JSON <http://json.org/>`_ is a lightweight data-interchange format. It
        is often used for exchanging data between a web server and user agent.
        
        This module aims to produce a library for serializing and deserializing
        JSON that conforms strictly to RFC 4627.
        
        .. contents::
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        jsonlib has two functions of interest, ``read`` and ``write``. It also
        defines some exception: ``ReadError``, ``WriteError``, and
        ``UnknownSerializerError``.
        
        For compatibility with the standard library, ``read`` is aliased to
        ``loads`` and ``write`` is aliased to ``dumps``. They do not have the
        same set of advanced parameters, but may be used interchangeably for
        simple invocations.
        
        Deserialization
        ---------------
        
        To deserialize a JSON expression, call the ``jsonlib.read`` function with
        an instance of ``str`` or ``bytes``. ::
        
        	>>> import jsonlib
        	>>> jsonlib.read (b'["Hello world!"]')
        	['Hello world!']
        
        Floating-point values
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        By default, ``jsonlib`` will parse values such as "1.1" into an instance of
        ``decimal.Decimal``. To use the built-in value type ``float`` instead, set
        the ``use_float`` parameter to ``True``. ``float``s are much faster to
        construct, so this flag may substantially increase parser performance.
        
        Please note that using ``float``s will cause a loss of precision when
        parsing some values. ::
        
        	>>> jsonlib.read ('[3.14159265358979323846]', use_float = True)
        	[3.141592653589793]
        
        Serialization
        -------------
        
        Serialization has more options, but they are set to reasonable defaults.
        The simplest use is to call ``jsonlib.write`` with a Python value. ::
        
        	>>> import jsonlib
        	>>> jsonlib.write (['Hello world!'])
        	b'["Hello world!"]'
        
        Pretty-Printing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To "pretty-print" the output, pass a value for the ``indent`` parameter. ::
        
        	>>> print (jsonlib.write (['Hello world!'], indent = '    ').decode ('utf8'))
        	[
        	    "Hello world!"
        	]
        	>>> 
        	
        Mapping Key Sorting
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        By default, mapping keys are serialized in whatever order they are
        stored by Python. To force a consistent ordering (for example, in doctests)
        use the ``sort_keys`` parameter. ::
        
        	>>> jsonlib.write ({'e': 'Hello', 'm': 'World!'})
        	b'{"m":"World!","e":"Hello"}'
        	>>> jsonlib.write ({'e': 'Hello', 'm': 'World!'}, sort_keys = True)
        	b'{"e":"Hello","m":"World!"}'
        
        Encoding and Unicode
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        By default, the output is encoded in UTF-8. If you require a different
        encoding, pass the name of a Python codec as the ``encoding`` parameter. ::
        
        	>>> jsonlib.write (['Hello world!'], encoding = 'utf-16-be')
        	b'\x00[\x00"\x00H\x00e\x00l\x00l\x00o\x00 \x00w\x00o\x00r\x00l\x00d\x00!\x00"\x00]'
        
        To retrieve an unencoded ``unicode`` instance, pass ``None`` for the
        encoding. ::
        
        	>>> jsonlib.write (['Hello world!'], encoding = None)
        	'["Hello world!"]'
        
        By default, non-ASCII codepoints are forbidden in the output. To include
        higher codepoints in the output, set ``ascii_only`` to ``False``. ::
        
        	>>> jsonlib.write (['Hello \u266a'], encoding = None)
        	'["Hello \\u266a"]'
        	>>> jsonlib.write (['Hello \u266a'], encoding = None, ascii_only = False)
        	'["Hello \u266a"]'
        
        Mapping Key Coercion
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Because JSON objects must have string keys, an exception will be raised when
        non-string keys are encountered in a mapping. It can be useful to coerce
        mapping keys to strings, so the ``coerce_keys`` parameter is available. ::
        
        	>>> jsonlib.write ({True: 1})
        	Traceback (most recent call last):
        	jsonlib.WriteError: Only strings may be used as object keys.
        	>>> jsonlib.write ({True: 1}, coerce_keys = True)
        	b'{"True":1}'
        
        Serializing Other Types
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If the object implements the iterator or mapping protocol, it will be
        handled automatically. If the object is intended for use as a basic value,
        it should subclass one of the supported basic values.
        
        String-like objects that do not inherit from ``unicode`` or
        ``UserString.UserString`` will likely be serialized as a list. This will
        not be changed. If iterating them returns an instance of the same type, the
        serializer might crash. This (hopefully) will be changed.
        
        To serialize a type not known to jsonlib, use the ``on_unknown`` parameter
        to ``write``::
        
        	>>> from datetime import date
        	>>> def unknown_handler (value, unknown):
        	...     if isinstance (value, date):
        	...         return str (value)
        	...     unknown (value)
        	>>> jsonlib.write ([date (2000, 1, 1)], on_unknown = unknown_handler)
        	b'["2000-01-01"]'
        
        Streaming Serializer
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        When serializing large objects, the use of an in-memory buffer may cause
        too much memory to be used. For these situations, use the ``dump`` function
        to write objects to a file-like object::
        
        	>>> import sys
        	>>> jsonlib.dump (["Written to stdout"], sys.stdout, encoding = None)
        	["Written to stdout"]
        	>>> with open ("/dev/null", "wb") as out:
        	...     jsonlib.dump (["Written to a file"], out)
        	>>> 
        
        Exceptions
        -----------
        
        ReadError
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Raised by ``read`` if an error was encountered parsing the expression. Will
        contain the line, column, and character position of the error.
        
        Note that this will report the *character*, not the *byte*, of the character
        that caused the error.
        
        WriteError
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Raised by ``write`` or ``dump`` if an error was encountered serializing
        the passed value.
        
        UnknownSerializerError
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A subclass of ``WriteError`` that is raised when a value cannot be
        serialized. See the ``on_unknown`` parameter to ``write``.
        
        Change Log
        ==========

        * Ported to Python 3.
        * ``coerce_keys`` no longer attempts to determine the "JSON" format for
          a coerced value -- it will simply call ``str()``.
        * Serializing byte strings is no longer supported -- please use ``str``
          objects instead.
        
        1.3.10

        * Add ``loads()`` and ``dumps()`` as aliases to ``read()`` and ``write()``,
          respectively, for compatibility with the new ``json`` standard library
          module.
        * Small fixes to the test suite to clear spurious errors caused by
          differences between the behavior of ``repr()`` on instances of
          ``decimal.Decimal`` and ``UnicodeDecodeError``.

        * Merged all code into ``jsonlib`` and ``_jsonlib`` modules, instead of
          a package.
        
        1.3.2
        -----

        * Added ``encoding`` parameter to ``write``, which controls the output
          encoding. The default encoding is ``utf-8``. If the encoding is ``None``,
          a ``unicode`` string will be returned.
        * Implemented ``write`` using a C extension module.
        
        1.2.7

        1.2.6
        -----
        
        Thanks to Deron Meranda (author of ``demjson``) for his excellent `JSON
        library comparison <http://deron.meranda.us/python/comparing_json_modules/>`_,
        which revealed many areas for improvement:
        
        * Use ``repr`` instead of ``unicode`` for serializing floating-point values,
          to avoid unnecessary rounding.
        * Fixed bug that prevented plus signs in an exponent from being parsed
          correctly.
        * Added support for serializing the following types:
        
          - ``generator``
          - ``set``
          - ``frozenset``
          - ``complex``, for values with no imaginary component.
          - ``array.array``
          - ``collections.deque``
          - ``collections.defaultdict``
          - ``UserList.UserList``
          - ``UserDict.UserDict``
          - ``UserString.UserString``
        
        * Raise an exception if a control character is encountered in a string.
        * Added support for detecting Unicode byte order marks in the auto decoder.
        * Allow only arrays and objects to be serialized directly. All other types
          must be contained within an array or object.
        * Stricter detection of whitespace.
        
        Also includes some other miscellaneous fixes:
        
        * More reliable detection of ``Infinity`` and ``NaN`` on Windows.
        * Support for decoding UTF-32 on UCS2 builds of Python.
        * Faster detection of self-recursive containers.
        
        1.2.5
        -----
        * Return Unicode strings from ``write``, so the user can control the final
          encoding.
        * Prevent ``Infinity``, ``-Infinity``, and ``NaN`` from being serialized
          because JSON does not support these values.
        * Added ``coerce_keys`` parameter to ``write``. If ``True``, mapping keys
          will be coerced to strings. Defaults to ``False``.
        * Added ``ascii_only`` parameter to ``write``. If ``True``, non-ASCII
          codepoints will always be escaped to a \u sequence. Defaults to ``True``.
        * Real detection of self-recursive container types.
        * Escape the solidus to prevent against `security issues
          <http://t3.dotgnu.info/blog/insecurity/quotes-dont-help.html>`_.
        
        1.2.4
        -----
        * Fixed bug that prevented characters from being read after reading a
          Unicode escape sequence.
        * Moved test cases into ``jsonlib.tests`` subpackage.
        
        1.2.3
        -----
        * Port to setuptools.
        * Corrected false positive in detection of illegal leading zeroes.
        
        1.2.2
        -----
        * Raise an exception if values in an object or array are not separated by
          commas.
        
        1.2.1
        -----
        * Support for building on Windows.
        
        1.2.0
        -----
        * Added ``sort_keys`` parameter to ``write``. This allows mapping types to
          be serialized to a predictable value, regardless of key ordering.
        * Added ``indent`` to ``write``. Any string passed as this value will be
          used for indentation. If the value is not `None`, pretty-printing will
          be activated.
        
        1.1.0
        -----
        * Support for reading astral Unicode codepoints on UCS2 builds of Python.
        
        1.0.0
        -----
        * Initial release.
